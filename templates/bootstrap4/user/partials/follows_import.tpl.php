No need to remove manga that you have followed on MangaDex, as those will be ignored. Your JSON will be imported immediately. If it does not, email your JSON to mangadexstaff@gmail.com. Please note that only the JSON exported directly from the offical batoto follows exporter works. Non-offical JSONs will most likely fail to import. To export from Batoto, export the 'JSON (full)' file with your batoto account at https://vatoto.com/myfollows in the right sidebar."></textarea>
